## What's Maven?

Maven is a popular open-source build tool developed by the Apache Group to build, publish, and deploy several projects at once for better project management. The tool provides allows developers to build and document the life cycle framework.

Maven focuses on the simplification and standardization of the building process, taking care of the following:

- Builds
- Documentation
- Dependencies
- Reports 
- SCMs
- Distribution
- Releases
- Mailing list

Mavenâ€™s purpose is to provide developers with:

- A comprehensive, maintainable, reusable, and simple model for projects.
- A set of tools and plug-ins that can interact with the declarative model.

Maven is based on the Project Object Model (POM).

**What is a Maven Archetype?**

Archetype is a Maven project templating toolkit. Archetypes get the users up and running giving them a sample project showing many Maven's features.

## Why do we use Maven?

Main advantages:

- Building the .jar, files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages.

- Downloading and installing dependencies from mvnrepository.com. No need to download the dependencies via the official websites.

- Generating pre-built templates for different types of projects and create the right project structure, which is essential for execution.

- Building and deploying the project to make it work.

- Generating JavaDoc documentation in HTML format.

  

- Easy access to all the required information.

- Easy to run on the command line.

- Supported by all major IDEs.

## What is POM?

A Project Object Model or POM is the fundamental unit of work in Maven. It's an XML file that has all the information regarding the Maven project and configuration details. It also includes the plugins used by Maven in the project.

Some of the configuration that can be specified in the POM are the project dependencies, the plugins or goals that can be executed, the build profiles, and so on. To add a dependency to POM we can install it on our IDE or go to an official repository and place the code between the marker.

For more information on POM, check [maven.apache.org](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html).
